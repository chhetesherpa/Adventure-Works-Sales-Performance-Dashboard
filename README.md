# Project: 🚴 Adventure Works Sales & Performance Dashboard (Power BI)


#  📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built using the Adventure Works Bike Store dataset as part of the Maven Analytics – Power BI Desktop Course.

The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends to support data-driven decision-making for a global bicycle manufacturing company.


The dashboard demonstrates my ability to:

a) Transform and model data using Power Query

b) Build efficient data models with proper relationships

c) Write DAX measures for advanced analytics

d) Design interactive, executive-ready dashboards


#  🧠 Business Objectives

The dashboard answers key business questions such as:

1) How are revenue, profit, orders, returns and return rate (%) trending over time?

2) Which products and categories drive the most revenue?

3) How do customer segments differ in purchasing behavior?

4) What is the regional performance across countries? (presented via map visual)

5) Who are the top customers, and what products do they buy?
